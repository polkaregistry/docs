# Polkregistry

This repo documents architecture and other related stuff of the proposed identity registrar on
Polkadot, maintained by Wei.

* [Overview](./overview.md)
* [Architecture](./architecture.md)

## Operations

This project will be ran as an open source side project of Wei, and thus it
requires no funding. Registrar verification on-chain will be provided for free
without fees. However, Wei may send treasury tip proposals later in order to
cover necessary transaction fees.
