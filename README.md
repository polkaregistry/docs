# Polkregistry

This repo documents architecture and other related stuff of the proposed identity registrar on
Polkadot, maintained by Wei. To read the documents, you'll most likely want to
visit the rendered [Polkaregistry webstie](https://polkaregistry.org).

## Operations

This project will be ran as an open source side project of Wei, and thus it
requires no funding. Registrar verification on-chain will be provided for free
without fees. However, Wei may send treasury tip proposals later in order to
cover necessary transaction fees.
